### Who are we?

We are a small group of developers and VR enthusiasts who felt there was a need for a project like this. Many of us already love the existing offerings out there, but wanted our own self-sustainable platform which could survive on the backs of its community, rather than being tied to the life of a company and a small group of individuals with exclusive control over its direction.

### What do we offer?

We have built a framework for the Godot game engine which makes the distribution of custom avatars and worlds in a networked environment possible. Our current plan is to offer hosting via our own web server, as well as individual server hosting and social functions, and in the future plan to broaden what we can offer. We have already been tackling many of the technical challenges required to make such a project possible on the Godot game engine, including:

    Spatialised audio and VOIP support
    Native VRM support
    Our own custom networking stack
    A security-focused sandboxed scripting environment backed by WASM
    Customisable servers with their own individual game rules

## About V-Sekai

We believe social VR should be a truly community-driven experience. For this to be realised, we believe the entire software stack should be available, moddable, and tweakable from the source up.
