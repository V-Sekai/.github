### What are we making?

We use the Godot game engine to distribute custom avatars and worlds in a networked environment. We plan to offer hosting via our own web server, as well as individual server hosting and social functions, and in the future plan to broaden what we can offer. We challenge many of the technical problems needed to make this project possible on the Godot game engine, including:

    - Spatialised audio and VOIP support
    - Native VRM support
    - Our own custom networking stack
    - A security-focused sandboxed scripting environment backed by WASM
    - Customisable servers with their own individual game rules

## About V-Sekai

V-Sekai is a small group of developers and VR enthusiasts who felt there was a need for an open-source ecosystem focused on VR. We believe social VR should be a truly community-driven experience. For this to be realised, we believe the entire software stack should be available, moddable, and tweakable from the source up, which is why a lot of our projects focus on the MIT-Licensed Godot Engine
