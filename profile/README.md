# What is V-Sekai?

V-Sekai is a community-run, self-hostable virtual reality platform. It is being built from the ground up to be an open and extensible tool for building social VR experiences. This allows anyone to create their own VR platforms and run them on their own servers or self-hosted environments. It's free, open source and it works with existing VR hardware.
